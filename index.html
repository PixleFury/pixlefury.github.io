	<h3>Shopping List Manager for Vulnerable People</h3>

	<p>My final year university project.  Inspired by the struggles vulnerable people had during COVID, it allows users to create shopping lists that can be sent to a helper to buy in-shop on their behalf.  The project consists of an Android app and Node.js server which communicate using a custom REST API.  The server manages user accounts, permissions, and sessions, as well as scrapes shopping websites for product descriptions, availability, and price; all of this is stored in a Postgresql database.</p>
